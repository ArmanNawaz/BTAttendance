# BT Attendance

Bluetooth based Attendance Monitoring System
An idea to reduce the time and effort used in taking the attendance manually, which requires pen and paper(register) mechanism.

This App will provide function to register students in the database mapped with their smartphone's bluetooth MAC address. As bluetooth MAC address is unique for each phone so this will uniquely identify each student. For taking attendance, teacher will open their smartphone press the take attendance button, choose class then press SCAN, this will scan all the bluetooth devices in the range and retrieve their MAC addresses matches with the database and mark their attendance. All these processes hardly takes ~15-20 seconds.
